Sublime Text 3 Data
===================

My Sublime Text 3 Data Folder. It has my theme, color scheme, package control, installed packages and configurations, ..

Install
=======

1. Backup your data folder and clear it out;
2. Clone or download the repo to the folder;
3. Restart ST (because of probable theme change, it can get a little weird if not restarted..).

Usage
=====

I use it on OSX, so here are some of the things to expect:

1. Indentation is done with tabs, corresponding to 4 spaces;
2. Theme is light, color scheme is dark;
3. I use tabs, sidebar is only present on projects;

Keymaps
=======

⌘ + \ - Reindent lines 
⌥ + ⇧ + Q - Switch quotes (from single to double and vice-versa)
